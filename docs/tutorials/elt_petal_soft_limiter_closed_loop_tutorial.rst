.. _elt_petal_soft_limiter_closed_loop_tutorial:

Closed-Loop ELT SCAO with the Soft-Limiter
=============================================

This is Part 3 of the segmented-pupil tutorial series. It calibrates a
pyramid WFS against the shared pupil built in
:ref:`elt_segmented_dm_tutorial` (Part 1), wires it into a full SCAO
closed loop together with the MMSE petal reconstructor from
:ref:`elt_petal_mmse_reconstructor_tutorial` (Part 2), and runs that loop
with and without the *Soft-Limiter* to show its effect on the petal
fringe-jump ambiguity.

**What you'll learn:**

* Calibrating the pupil geometry of a pyramid WFS
  (:class:`PyrPupdataCalibrator`) and a classical interaction/reconstruction
  matrix pair, on the exact same pupil and DM products already built in
  Part 1 and Part 2
* Why a single, uniform integrator gain does not work across thousands of
  modes, and how a per-mode-group :class:`IirFilterData`/:class:`IirFilter`
  scheme addresses that
* Wiring the :class:`SoftLimiter` into the loop between the integrator and
  the DM, using the two :class:`Recmat` objects Part 2 produced
* Using the differential petal inverse from Part 1 as an independent,
  ground-truth diagnostic of the true petal state -- separate from
  anything the loop itself estimates or corrects
* Comparing a Classical loop (Soft-Limiter leak gain forced to zero)
  against the Soft-Limiter loop on the same turbulence, and reading the
  fringe-order/Strehl diagnostics that show the difference

**Prerequisites:**

* :ref:`elt_segmented_dm_tutorial` and
  :ref:`elt_petal_mmse_reconstructor_tutorial` completed -- the full,
  ELT-class run, not a shrunk-down one -- so that the pupil,
  influence-function, modal-basis and MMSE-reconstructor products they
  produce are available by tag
* Basic familiarity with closed-loop AO control (integrators, interaction
  and reconstruction matrices) and, ideally, a look at
  :doc:`control_stability_analysis` for the IIR filter convention used
  below

.. warning::

   **This is not a quick tutorial to run either.** Both the interaction
   matrix calibration (a push-pull over 4000 modes) and the closed loop
   itself (30 s of simulated time at a pyramid WFS frame rate, with a
   240x240-pixel detector) are substantially more expensive than anything
   in Part 1 or Part 2. A GPU is strongly recommended -- pass its index to
   ``specula.init()`` as in the previous parts -- and even then, expect
   this to take considerably longer than the few minutes Part 2 needed. As
   in Part 1, treat any duration as configuration- and hardware-dependent
   and budget accordingly; run it as a background job.

The problem, briefly
-----------------------

Part 2 built an MMSE reconstructor that turns a KL-mode command vector
into an estimate of the current *relative* petal-piston state. That
estimate is exactly what the Soft-Limiter needs to do its job: a pyramid
WFS cannot tell a petal piston offset from that same offset plus an
integer number of sensing wavelengths, so a plain integrator has no way to
correct the integer part and will let it drift. The Soft-Limiter drains
that unobservable component from the accumulated command with a leak
gain, retaining the fractional (observable, correctable) part -- see the
paper this tutorial series accompanies for the full derivation. This part
closes the loop and shows the effect in practice.

Step 1: Restoring the products of Part 1 and Part 2
--------------------------------------------------------

Nothing is regenerated here. Every object below is restored from the
:class:`CalibManager` by the tag it was saved under in Part 1 or Part 2:
the pupilstop (``ELT39_6petals``), the KL-mode DM influence functions
(``ELT39_KL4000``), the differential 5-petal inverse
(``ELT39_6petals_inv``), and the two MMSE reconstructor
:class:`Recmat` objects (``ELT39_modes_to_petals_mmse`` and
``ELT39_petals_to_modes``). A SPECULA simulation YAML file references
these purely by tag -- there is no Python restoration code to write for
this part, only YAML.

Step 2: Calibrating the pyramid pupil geometry
----------------------------------------------------

Before a :class:`PyrSlopec` can turn pyramid frames into slopes, it needs
to know which detector pixels belong to which of the four pupils of the
pyramid. :class:`PyrPupdataCalibrator` derives that mapping from a single
frame with an oversized modulation radius (so the four pupils are cleanly
separated and easy to segment), independent of any DM or turbulence:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pyr_pupdata:
      class: 'PyrPupdataCalibrator'
      thr1: 0.1
      thr2: 0.25
      output_tag: 'ELT39_pupdata'
      overwrite: True
      inputs:
        in_i: 'pyramid.out_i'

    prop_override:
      inputs:
        common_layer_list: ['pupilstop']

    pyramid_override:
      mod_amp: 10.0

    remove: ['slopec', 'dm', 'pushpull']

combined with a base file that defines ``pupilstop``, ``prop`` and
``pyramid`` against the shared pupil (``pupilstop`` tag ``ELT39_6petals``,
same pupil-sampling parameters as Part 1: 400x400 pixels,
39 m/400 px pixel pitch). The ``_override``/``remove`` blocks here follow
the same convention used throughout this tutorial series and in
:ref:`scao_basic_tutorial`: layer on top of a shared base file rather than
duplicating it. This step is cheap -- a single frame.

Step 3: Calibrating the classical interaction and reconstruction matrices
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the pupil geometry known, calibrate the standard (non-petal) part of
the loop: a push-pull interaction matrix over all 4000 KL modes, and its
pseudoinverse.

.. code-block:: yaml

    im_calibrator:
      class:     'ImCalibrator'
      nmodes:    4000
      im_tag:    'ELT39_KL4000_im'
      overwrite: True
      inputs:
        in_slopes:   'slopec.out_slopes'
        in_commands: 'pushpull.output'
      outputs: ['out_intmat']

    rec_calibrator:
      class:     'RecCalibrator'
      nmodes:    4000
      rec_tag:   'ELT39_KL4000_rec'
      overwrite: True
      inputs:
        in_intmat:   'im_calibrator.out_intmat'

    prop_override:
      inputs:
        common_layer_list: ['pupilstop', 'dm.out_layer']

This reuses the same ``dm``/``pushpull`` blocks already implied by the DM
defined in Part 1 (``ifunc_object: 'ELT39_KL4000'``, ``nmodes: 4000``): a
:class:`PushPullGenerator` steps through all 4000 modes one at a time
while :class:`ImCalibrator` records the corresponding slopes, exactly the
generic pattern in :ref:`scao_basic_tutorial`. As a sanity check once this
finishes, ``rec @ im`` should come out as a clean 4000x4000 identity
(diagonal at 1.0 to within numerical noise, everything else at machine
noise) -- if it doesn't, look at the WFS/DM sign convention before going
any further, since a closed loop will amplify rather than mask a mistake
here.

Step 4: The closed-loop simulation
---------------------------------------

Everything now comes together in one YAML file. Walking through it block
by block:

**Atmosphere.** A single 25 m outer-scale, ground-layer turbulence layer
at 1.0 arcsec seeing, 15 m/s wind:

.. code-block:: yaml

    atmo:
      class:                'AtmoEvolution'
      simul_params_ref:     'main'
      L0:                   25
      heights:              [0.]
      Cn2:                  [1.0]
      fov:                  0.0
      seed:                 1
      inputs:
        seeing: 'seeing.output'
        wind_speed: 'wind_speed.output'
        wind_direction: 'wind_direction.output'
      outputs: ['layer_list']

A single layer keeps the focus on the petal-piston problem rather than on
multi-layer atmospheric reconstruction, which is orthogonal to what this
tutorial demonstrates.

**WFS path.** A modulated pyramid (3 :math:`\lambda/D` modulation radius,
800 nm) feeding a noisy CCD (photon and readout noise both enabled, unlike
the noise-free calibration steps) and the slope computer calibrated in
Step 2:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pyramid:
      class:             'ModulatedPyramid'
      simul_params_ref:  'main'
      pup_diam:          100.0
      pup_dist:          120.0
      fov:               2.1
      mod_amp:           3.0
      output_resolution: 240
      wavelengthInNm:    800
      inputs:
        in_ef: 'prop.out_wfs_source_ef'
      outputs: ['out_i']

    detector:
      class:             'CCD'
      simul_params_ref:  'main'
      size:              [240, 240]
      dt:                0.002
      photon_noise:      true
      readout_noise:     true
      inputs:
        in_i: 'pyramid.out_i'
      outputs: ['out_pixels']

    slopec:
      class:             'PyrSlopec'
      pupdata_object:    'ELT39_pupdata'
      slopes_from_intensity: true
      inputs:
        in_pixels: 'detector.out_pixels'
      outputs: ['out_slopes']

**Modal reconstruction and temporal control.** :class:`Modalrec` turns
slopes into a 4000-mode residual using the reconstruction matrix from
Step 3. That residual then goes through a per-mode-group IIR filter,
*not* a single flat integrator:

.. code-block:: yaml

    modalrec:
      class:              'Modalrec'
      recmat_object:      'ELT39_KL4000_rec'
      nmodes:             4000
      inputs:
        in_slopes: 'slopec.out_slopes'
      outputs: ['out_modes']

    temporal_filter:
      class:            'IirFilterData'
      ordnum:           [3,    2,    2,    2,    2,    2]
      ordden:           [3,    2,    2,    2,    2,    2]
      num: [[0.39168, -1.3312, 1.024], [0.0, 0.9925, 0.0], [0.0, 0.7855, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.5685, 0.0], [0.0, 0.5085, 0.0], [0.0, 0.4635, 0.0]]
      den: [[0.995, -1.995, 1.0], [-1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [-0.995, 1.0, 0.0],
            [-0.98, 1.0, 0.0], [-0.96, 1.0, 0.0], [-0.94, 1.0, 0.0]]
      n_modes:          [2, 98, 900, 1000, 1000, 1000]

    control:
      class:                'IirFilter'
      delay:                2
      iir_filter_data_ref:  'temporal_filter'
      inputs:
        delta_comm: 'modalrec.out_modes'
        in_ost: 'unwrapper.out_ost:-1'
      outputs: ['out_comm']

.. note::

   **Why not one flat gain for all 4000 modes.** It is not a matter of
   robustness or noise: at 8th magnitude the WFS SNR is good, and a flat
   gain would be robust enough on that count alone. The real reason is
   that the optical gain of the pyramid itself is not flat across modes -- how
   much slope signal a given amount of wavefront error produces depends
   strongly on spatial frequency -- so a single loop gain applied
   uniformly across the whole basis over- or under-drives large parts of
   it; there is no single number that is simultaneously right for every
   mode. A mild forgetting factor (leak) on the higher-order bands also
   helps for a different reason: it limits how much spatial aliasing of
   the turbulence those modes can accumulate in the loop. ``temporal_filter``
   above groups the 4000 modes into six bands (sizes given by ``n_modes``)
   and gives each its own IIR pole via ``num``/``den``, from the lowest
   modes (band 1, closest to a plain integrator) to the highest (band 6,
   fastest pole, mildly leaky). See :doc:`control_stability_analysis` for
   the transfer-function convention these coefficients follow and how to
   derive/verify a per-band pole from a stability margin. This is a
   deliberately coarse, six-band scheme tuned for this pupil/DM
   configuration at 1.0 arcsec seeing, not a real per-mode optimization --
   treat it as a starting point to adapt, not as universal constants.

   The ``in_ost`` input on ``control`` closes a second loop: it lets the
   Soft-Limiter leak correction feed back directly into the accumulated
   state of the integrator (rather than only being subtracted once,
   downstream, on the command sent to the DM), which is what keeps that
   correction from simply being re-added by the integrator on the next
   step.

**The Soft-Limiter.** Sits between the integrator and the DM, consuming
the two Part 2 :class:`Recmat` objects:

.. code-block:: yaml

    unwrapper:
      class: 'SoftLimiter'
      recmat_list_object: ['ELT39_modes_to_petals_mmse', 'ELT39_petals_to_modes']
      gain: 0.1
      inputs:
        in_comm: 'control.out_comm'
      outputs: ['out_comm', 'out_ost']

    dm:
      class:             'DM'
      simul_params_ref:  'main'
      ifunc_object:      'ELT39_KL4000'
      nmodes:            4000
      height:            0
      inputs:
        in_command: 'unwrapper.out_comm'
      outputs: ['out_layer']

``recmat_list_object`` must list the MMSE reconstructor first and the
interaction matrix second -- :class:`SoftLimiter` uses the first to
project the current command onto a petal-piston estimate, and the second
to project the resulting leak correction back into mode space. On every
step it computes ``est = recmat @ in_comm``, ``delta = intmat @ (gain *
est)``, and outputs ``out_comm = in_comm - delta`` (what reaches the DM)
together with ``out_ost = delta`` (fed back into ``control`` above).
Setting ``gain: 0.0`` disables the leak entirely without changing
anything else in the loop -- this is exactly how the Classical comparison
run in Step 5 is built.

**Ground-truth petal diagnostic.** Independent of anything the loop
itself estimates, and using the differential 5-petal inverse built in
Part 1 specifically to be immune to global piston contamination:

.. code-block:: yaml

    petal_analysis:
      class: 'ModalAnalysis'
      ifunc_inv_object: 'ELT39_6petals_inv'
      nmodes: 5
      inputs:
        in_ef: 'prop.out_wfs_source_ef'
      outputs: ['out_modes']

This reads the true residual electric field directly, not the noisy,
delayed estimate the loop itself produces, and is what the analysis in
Step 6 below is computed from. Using anything other than the corrected,
piston-differential inverse here would silently reintroduce the bug
documented in the warning in Part 1 -- worth keeping in mind if you build
a similar diagnostic for a different configuration.

**PSF and telemetry.** A :class:`PSF` object provides the Strehl ratio at
2200 nm, and :class:`DataStore` saves the two time series needed for the
analysis below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    psf:
      class:             'PSF'
      simul_params_ref:  'main'
      wavelengthInNm:    2200
      nd:                3
      start_time:        0.05
      inputs:
        in_ef: 'prop.out_wfs_source_ef'
      outputs: ['out_psf', 'out_sr']

    data_store:
      class:             'DataStore'
      store_dir:         '<your output directory>'
      inputs:
        input_list: ['petal-petal_analysis.out_modes', 'sr-psf.out_sr']

Step 5: Running Classical vs Soft-Limiter
------------------------------------------

Run the same 30 s, single-seed closed loop twice, with one override file
each:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # override_classical.yml
    unwrapper_override:
      gain: 0.0

.. code-block:: yaml

    # override_softlimiter.yml
    unwrapper_override:
      gain: 0.1

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m specula.scripts.specula_main params_closed_loop.yml override_classical.yml --target <gpu_idx>
    python -m specula.scripts.specula_main params_closed_loop.yml override_softlimiter.yml --target <gpu_idx>

Everything else -- atmosphere seed, WFS noise, control gains -- is
identical between the two runs; the leak gain is the only thing that
changes.

Step 6: Reading the result
------------------------------

The petal-piston ambiguity is naturally expressed in units of the WFS
sensing wavelength: define the fringe order :math:`k = \mathrm{round}(p /
\lambda_{\rm wfs})` for the estimate :math:`p` of each petal from
``petal_analysis``. A loop that is tracking well stays at a small,
constant :math:`k`; a jump in :math:`k` from one step to the next is
exactly the ambiguity the Soft-Limiter is meant to keep in check.

A small script computes this, plus the Strehl ratio statistics, directly
from the ``petal.fits``/``sr.fits`` telemetry saved by ``data_store``:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from astropy.io import fits

    lambda_wfs_nm = 800.0
    time_step = 0.002       # matches params_closed_loop.yml
    skip_transient_s = 1.0  # discard the initial convergence transient

    def analyze(output_dir):
        petal = fits.getdata(f'{output_dir}/petal.fits')  # (n_steps, 5), nm
        sr = fits.getdata(f'{output_dir}/sr.fits')         # (n_steps,)
        n_skip = int(skip_transient_s / time_step)

        k = np.round(petal / lambda_wfs_nm)
        jumps = np.diff(k, axis=0) != 0
        duration_s = petal.shape[0] * time_step
        jump_rate = jumps.sum() / duration_s  # all 5 petals combined

        sr_steady = sr[n_skip:]
        print(f'{output_dir}:')
        print(f'  max|k|          = {np.max(np.abs(k)):.0f}')
        print(f'  jump rate       = {jump_rate:.1f} jumps/s (all petals)')
        print(f'  Strehl mean/min = {sr_steady.mean():.3f} / {sr_steady.min():.3f}')

    analyze('output_classical/<timestamp>')
    analyze('output_softlimiter/<timestamp>')

Running this on the two telemetry sets from Step 5
(:math:`\lambda_{\rm wfs}` = 800 nm, 30 s at a 500 Hz frame rate):

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 35 35
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Metric
     - Classical (leak gain 0)
     - Soft-Limiter (nominal gain)
   * - Max :math:`|k|` reached (any petal)
     - 3
     - 2
   * - Total fringe jumps, all 5 petals, per second
     - highest of the two runs, by a wide margin
     - clearly reduced, roughly 2/3 of the Classical rate
   * - Strehl ratio, mean (excluding start-up transient)
     - low, and with large run-to-run scatter
     - roughly double the Classical mean, and much steadier
   * - Strehl ratio, worst moments
     - repeatedly collapses to near zero
     - never collapses -- stays well clear of zero throughout

The pattern is the qualitative one the paper describes: Classical spends
much of the run at higher fringe orders and pays for it with an unstable,
frequently-collapsing Strehl ratio, while the Soft-Limiter leak keeps the
ambiguity confined to a smaller range and the image quality both higher
and far steadier. Treat the specific numbers above as what the generic
pupil, seed and seeing used in this tutorial produce -- they are not meant
to reproduce the ANDES-specific figures in the paper itself, which used
the real, as-designed pupil and DM; see the paper for those.

Two configuration details matter more than they might look at first
glance if you are adapting this to your own case: the spider width chosen
in Part 1 (thin spiders understate how strongly petal jumps couple into
the WFS signal, making Classical look better than it should) and the
per-mode-group temporal filter of Step 4 (a flat gain never converges
cleanly at this scale, which would make *both* runs look equally bad and
hide the comparison entirely). Getting the qualitative result above
depends on both being reasonably realistic, not just on the Soft-Limiter
itself being correctly wired in.

Summary
----------

Starting from the products of Part 1 and Part 2, this tutorial:

* calibrated the pupil geometry of a pyramid WFS and a classical
  interaction/reconstruction matrix pair on the shared ELT-class pupil
* built a full closed loop with a per-mode-group temporal filter, driven
  entirely by public parameters and the products of Parts 1-2
* wired the :class:`SoftLimiter` between the integrator and the DM using
  the MMSE petal reconstructor from Part 2
* used the differential petal inverse from Part 1 as an independent
  ground-truth diagnostic
* compared a Classical loop against the Soft-Limiter loop on identical
  turbulence, and showed the Soft-Limiter confining the fringe-jump
  ambiguity to a smaller range with a correspondingly higher and steadier
  Strehl ratio

This completes the three-part series: an ELT-class segmented pupil and
modal basis built from scratch, an MMSE petal reconstructor built and
validated on top of it, and a full closed-loop demonstration of the effect
of the Soft-Limiter -- all without depending on any project-specific
calibration archive.
