.. _elt_petal_mmse_reconstructor_tutorial:

Building an MMSE Petal Reconstructor from a KL Modal Basis
==============================================================

This is Part 2 of the segmented-pupil tutorial series. It uses the pupil
mask, petal influence functions, and KL modal basis built in
:ref:`elt_segmented_dm_tutorial` (Part 1) to build a **reconstructor from
KL-mode commands to petal-piston estimates** -- the piece a closed-loop
simulation needs to know the current petal state without depending on any
project-specific calibration file.

**What you'll learn:**

* Why the petal-to-mode transform must be built *consistently* with the
  modal basis it will operate on, and how to guarantee that starting from
  the shared-mask design of Part 1
* Building a petals-to-modes interaction matrix from two influence-function
  sets that live on the same pixel grid
* Why a plain geometric projection is not enough, and what the *M* in MMSE
  actually buys you
* Computing a turbulence covariance matrix in modal space with
  :func:`compute_ifs_covmat`, and a reconstructor with
  :func:`compute_mmse_reconstructor`
* Validating the reconstructor statistically, against atmosphere-like
  turbulence plus known injected petal offsets, before ever wiring it into
  a closed loop

**Prerequisites:**

* :ref:`elt_segmented_dm_tutorial` completed -- the full run, not a
  shrunk-down version; this tutorial restores its products by tag and does
  not regenerate them, and (see the note in Step 2) a modal basis with too
  little spatial bandwidth cannot represent the petal signal it needs to
  reconstruct, regardless of how correct the reconstructor code is
* Basic familiarity with modal wavefront reconstruction (interaction
  matrices, reconstruction matrices)

The problem
--------------

In closed loop, a pyramid WFS gives you a residual expressed in whatever
modal basis the loop controls -- here, KL-mode coefficients. But the
Soft-Limiter needs to know something the WFS does not report directly: the
current *petal-piston* state, i.e. how the six independent primary-mirror
support structures are offset from each other. That state is buried inside
the KL-mode residual, mixed in with ordinary atmospheric turbulence.

We need a matrix, call it :math:`W`, that turns a KL-mode vector into a
petal-piston estimate:

.. math::

   \hat{p} = W \cdot m

and (for the reverse direction, used later to inject a petal correction
back into the loop as a DM command) an interaction matrix :math:`A` that
turns a petal offset into the KL-mode vector it would produce:

.. math::

   m = A \cdot p

Why a plain projection is not enough
-----------------------------------------

The geometrically obvious way to get :math:`A` is a projection: express
the piston pattern of each petal in the KL basis. And the geometrically obvious
way to get :math:`W` is to invert :math:`A`. That works in the noise-free
case, but a real KL-mode vector is never *just* the petal signal -- it is
the petal signal plus whatever atmospheric turbulence happens to be present
that frame, and the two are not separable mode-by-mode. A plain
pseudo-inverse of :math:`A` would treat every KL mode as equally
informative about the petal state, when in reality the high-order modes
carry little turbulent power and are mostly noise for this particular
estimation problem.

The **MMSE** (Minimum Mean Square Error) reconstructor instead down-weights
each mode according to how much genuine turbulence power it is expected to
carry, using the actual mode covariance as a statistical prior. Concretely:

.. math::

   W_{\rm mmse} = \left( A^T C_m^{-1} A + C_p^{-1} \right)^{-1} A^T C_m^{-1}

where :math:`C_p` is the prior covariance of the petal state we are trying
to estimate, and :math:`C_m` is the covariance of the KL-mode turbulence
that competes with the petal signal. SPECULA implements this directly as
:func:`compute_mmse_reconstructor` -- the work in this tutorial is building
:math:`A`, :math:`C_p`, and :math:`C_m` correctly, not the estimator
formula itself.

.. note::

   **A cautionary tale.** Building :math:`A` and :math:`W` from two
   *independently generated* petal/modal bases -- rather than from a single
   shared pupil mask, as Part 1 deliberately sets up -- is a real trap: even
   a subtly different pixel rasterization between the two bases leaves them
   not quite consistent inverses of each other, and the resulting cross-talk
   is very difficult to diagnose after the fact (everything still looks
   reasonable in isolation; it only shows up as a puzzling bias deep inside
   a closed-loop run). This tutorial avoids that entirely by building both
   :math:`A` and :math:`W` from the petal and KL bases generated together
   in Part 1, on the same shared mask.

Step 1: Restore the products of Part 1
-------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    import specula
    specula.init(-1)

    from specula import xp, np, cpuArray
    from specula.calib_manager import CalibManager
    from specula.data_objects.ifunc import IFunc
    from specula.data_objects.ifunc_inv import IFuncInv

    calib = CalibManager('./calib_elt_segmented_dm_tutorial')

    petal_ifunc_obj = IFunc.restore(calib.filename('ifunc', 'ELT39_6petals'))
    kl_ifunc_obj = IFunc.restore(calib.filename('ifunc', 'ELT39_KL4000'))
    kl_inv_obj = IFuncInv.restore(calib.filename('ifunc', 'ELT39_KL4000_inv'))

    petal_ifunc = petal_ifunc_obj.influence_function       # (6, n_valid)
    kl_basis = kl_ifunc_obj.influence_function              # (n_modes, n_valid)
    influence_function_inv = kl_inv_obj.ifunc_inv            # (n_valid, n_modes)
    pupil_mask = kl_ifunc_obj.mask_inf_func

    n_petals = petal_ifunc.shape[0]
    n_modes, n_valid = kl_basis.shape

    assert petal_ifunc.shape[1] == n_valid, \
        "petal and KL bases are on different pixel grids!"

    print(f'petal_ifunc {petal_ifunc.shape}, kl_basis {kl_basis.shape}, '
          f'influence_function_inv {influence_function_inv.shape}')

``petal_ifunc`` and ``kl_basis`` should agree on the second dimension --
the number of valid pixels in the shared mask from Part 1 -- with the
first dimension of ``kl_basis`` at 4000 (the modes kept) and
``influence_function_inv`` simply that shape transposed.

The ``assert`` is the same shared-mask safety check from Part 1 -- restoring
by tag does not remove the risk of a mismatch, it just moves it later in
time, so it is worth checking again here.

Step 2: The petals-to-modes interaction matrix
----------------------------------------------------

The six raw petal influence functions from Part 1 (piston = 1 inside a
petal, 0 elsewhere) are what we use directly -- there was no need to build
a separate "relative petal" basis. The pyramid cannot see an absolute
piston offset applied identically to all six petals, so that global mode is
invisible to any reconstructor built this way; the standard fix is to treat
one petal as a reference and describe the other five *relative to it*. We
do that here simply by dropping the row for the last petal before
projecting, which is enough (and is checked explicitly below):

.. code-block:: python

    petal_ifunc_5 = petal_ifunc[:n_petals - 1, :]     # (5, n_valid), petal 6 is the reference

    # Project the raw piston pattern of each petal onto the KL basis: this
    # is the same pseudo-inverse trick as the IFuncInv from Part 1, just
    # applied here to a different signal (a petal shape) instead of to a
    # phase screen.
    intmat = petal_ifunc_5 @ influence_function_inv    # (5, n_modes)
    intmat = intmat.T                                     # (n_modes, 5), the A matrix

    print('intmat (n_modes, 5):', intmat.shape)

.. note::

   **Is dropping one petal equivalent to a proper differential basis?**
   Yes, exactly, not an approximation: the six raw petal masks sum, pixel
   for pixel, to the uniform (global piston) pattern, which projects to
   KL-mode RMS ~3e-17 (machine-precision zero, since the KL basis carries
   no piston). The six raw influence functions are therefore rank-5, not
   rank-6, and dropping petal 6 discards exactly that redundant,
   unobservable direction and nothing else.

Step 3: Turbulence covariance in KL-mode space
----------------------------------------------------

This is :math:`C_m`: how much power ordinary atmospheric turbulence puts
into each KL mode (and how the modes correlate), independent of any petal
signal. :func:`compute_ifs_covmat` -- the same routine Part 1 uses
internally to rank the KL basis -- gives us this directly from the forward
KL basis and an ``r0``/``L0`` pair:

.. code-block:: python

    from specula.lib.modal_base_generator import compute_ifs_covmat

    telescope_diameter = 39.0
    r0 = 0.15
    L0 = 25.0

    c_modes = compute_ifs_covmat(pupil_mask, telescope_diameter, kl_basis,
                                  r0, L0, oversampling=2, xp=xp, dtype=xp.float32)
    print('c_modes:', c_modes.shape)

::

    c_modes: (4000, 4000)

Step 4: Petal prior covariance
------------------------------------

This is :math:`C_p`: the prior covariance of the petal state itself, as
opposed to :math:`C_m`, the covariance of what competes with it. Following
the paper this tutorial accompanies (Sect. 3, Eq. 2), we use a plain
isotropic, deliberately *uninformative* prior, :math:`C_p = \sigma_p^2 I`:

.. code-block:: python

    petal_sigma_nm = 800.0   # see note below: the exact value barely matters

    c_petals = (petal_sigma_nm ** 2) * xp.eye(n_petals - 1, dtype=xp.float32)
    print('c_petals:', c_petals.shape)

::

    c_petals: (5, 5)

.. note::

   The paper shows the output of this static estimator is essentially
   invariant to :math:`\sigma_p` across more than six orders of magnitude (8 nm to
   8e6 nm): for any sufficiently uninformative prior, the estimator
   converges to the Gauss-Markov (minimum-variance-unbiased) limit, so
   ``petal_sigma_nm`` is not really a tunable parameter of the method --
   any plausible order of magnitude works.

Step 5: Computing and checking the reconstructor
------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    from specula.lib.mmse_reconstructor import compute_mmse_reconstructor

    mmse_recmat = compute_mmse_reconstructor(
        intmat, c_petals, xp, xp.float32,
        noise_variance=None, c_noise=c_modes, c_inverse=False)
    print('mmse_recmat:', mmse_recmat.shape)

    # Sanity check: applied to the noise-free interaction matrix, the
    # reconstructor should recover a (5, 5) identity -- this is exactly the
    # check that would catch a shared-mask mismatch of the kind described
    # above, and it also confirms that dropping the sixth (reference)
    # petal, rather than building a separate 5-mode "relative petal" basis,
    # was a safe simplification: there is no leftover cross-talk.
    print(np.round(cpuArray(mmse_recmat @ intmat), 3))

::

    mmse_recmat: (5, 4000)
    [[ 1. -0. -0. -0. -0.]
     [-0.  1. -0. -0. -0.]
     [-0. -0.  1. -0. -0.]
     [-0. -0. -0.  1. -0.]
     [-0. -0. -0. -0.  1.]]

(Computing ``c_modes`` and ``mmse_recmat`` at this scale takes a few
minutes -- comparatively cheap next to Part 1.)

Saving the reconstructor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    from specula.data_objects.recmat import Recmat

    rec_obj = Recmat(mmse_recmat)
    rec_filename = calib.filename('rec', 'ELT39_modes_to_petals_mmse')
    rec_obj.save(rec_filename, overwrite=True)

    im_obj = Recmat(intmat)
    im_filename = calib.filename('rec', 'ELT39_petals_to_modes')
    im_obj.save(im_filename, overwrite=True)

Step 6: Statistical validation with atmosphere-like commands
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The identity check above only proves the reconstructor is self-consistent
in the noise-free case. What matters in practice is how well it recovers a
*known* petal offset once realistic atmospheric turbulence is mixed in --
exactly the static estimation test described in the paper, Sect. 4.3
(Fig. 4 and Fig. 5): known petal offsets and turbulence are injected
together, and the error of the estimator is compared against the injected
truth. Rather than re-deriving expected numbers here, run it yourself
against the real ELT-class basis from Part 1 and compare against those
figures.

Code, using :class:`AtmoRandomPhase`-generated turbulence plus injected,
known-truth random petal offsets:

.. code-block:: python

    from specula.data_objects.pupilstop import Pupilstop
    from specula.data_objects.simul_params import SimulParams
    from specula.base_value import BaseValue
    from specula.processing_objects.atmo_random_phase import AtmoRandomPhase

    n_realizations = 300
    seeing_arcsec = 0.8
    np.random.seed(1234)

    dim = pupil_mask.shape[0]
    mask_bool = cpuArray(pupil_mask) > 0
    simul_params = SimulParams(time_step=1.0, pixel_pupil=dim,
                                pixel_pitch=telescope_diameter / dim)
    pupilstop = Pupilstop(simul_params, input_mask=mask_bool.astype(np.float32))

    atmo = AtmoRandomPhase(simul_params, L0=L0, data_dir='./atmo_phasescreens',
                            wavelengthInNm=500.0, pixel_phasescreens=2048, seed=1,
                            update_interval=1)
    seeing = BaseValue(value=xp.array([seeing_arcsec], dtype=xp.float32))
    atmo.inputs['pupilstop'].set(pupilstop)
    atmo.inputs['seeing'].set(seeing)
    atmo.setup()

    # Known-truth petal offsets, re-referenced to petal 6 exactly as in Step 2.
    true_petals = np.random.randn(n_realizations, n_petals).astype(np.float32) * petal_sigma_nm
    true_petals -= true_petals[:, [n_petals - 1]]
    true_petals = xp.asarray(true_petals)
    true_rel = true_petals[:, :n_petals - 1]

    # Project the injected petal offsets into KL-mode space the same way a
    # real petal step would appear in the modal residual of the loop.
    petal_modes = (true_petals @ petal_ifunc) @ influence_function_inv

    turb_modes = xp.zeros((n_realizations, n_modes), dtype=xp.float32)
    for i in range(n_realizations):
        t = atmo.seconds_to_t(float(i))
        seeing.generation_time = t
        pupilstop.generation_time = t
        atmo.check_ready(t)
        atmo.trigger()
        atmo.post_trigger()
        phase_vec = atmo.outputs['out_layer'].phaseInNm[mask_bool]
        turb_modes[i] = phase_vec @ influence_function_inv

    est_rel = (turb_modes + petal_modes) @ mmse_recmat.T
    err = cpuArray(est_rel - true_rel)

    rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean(err ** 2))
    bias = np.mean(err)
    print(f'RMSE = {rmse:.2f} nm, bias = {bias:.2f} nm')

Compare the resulting bias and RMS error against Fig. 4 and Sect. 4.3 of
the paper -- the same test, the same kind of input mixture (turbulence
plus injected petal offsets), evaluated on the real ELT-class basis rather
than a stand-in.

Summary and what's next
---------------------------

Starting from the products of Part 1, this tutorial built:

* a petals-to-modes interaction matrix (:math:`A`), consistent by
  construction with the KL basis because both come from the same shared
  pupil mask
* a turbulence covariance matrix in KL-mode space
* a petal-piston prior covariance
* an MMSE reconstructor from KL-mode commands to relative petal-piston
  estimates (:math:`W_{\rm mmse}`), saved as a :class:`Recmat`
* a statistical validation against atmosphere-like turbulence plus known
  petal offsets, confirming the reconstructor is unbiased before it is ever
  used in closed loop

What remains for a full closed-loop demonstration -- calibrating the
pyramid WFS itself (pupil geometry, interaction matrix, reconstruction
matrix) and running the loop with and without the Soft-Limiter -- is
covered in :ref:`segmented_pupil_soft_limiter_tutorial` (Part 3).
