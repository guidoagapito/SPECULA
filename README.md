# SPECULA
Python AO end-to-end simulator

SPECULA is a Python-based, object-oriented software derived from [PASSATA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07624) and developed
by the Adaptive Optics group at the Arcetri Observatory for end-to-end Monte-Carlo simulations of adaptive optics systems.
It can be accelerated using GPU-CUDA via CuPy.

See the documentation here: [specula.readthedocs.io](https://specula.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Directories

- **docs**: contains the documentation.
- **main**: contains functions and parameter files to calibrate and run a closed loop of an adaptive optics system (single-conjugated, multi-conjugated, natural, laser, ...).
- **specula**: the main library, structured as follows:
  - **data_objects**: classes that wrap the data and provide methods to access them.
  - **display**: classes for data visualization.
  - **lib**: utility functions used by multiple objects.
  - **processing_objects**: classes that model the simulation elements as a function of inputs and time.
  - **scripts**: various scripts.
- **test**: contains functions to test SPECULA using the `unittest` framework.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- flask
- flask-socketio
- socketio
- cupy (for GPU acceleration, optional)

### Optional libraries

Some features require additional libraries:
- **pycairo**: needed for block diagram generation with `orthogram`
- **orthogram**: for automatic block diagram creation (see [orthogram](https://pypi.org/project/orthogram/))

Install optional dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pycairo orthogram
```
